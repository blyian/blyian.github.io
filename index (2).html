        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Brian Chow and I am a second year economics major studying at the University of California, Riverside. I am orignally from Los Angeles and I was born and raised in that area. I began playing basketball at the age of 4 with my brother up until high school where I began playing volleyball and football. I also have 4 years of work experience. I began my first job during my junior year of high school as a tutuor at Kumon. Later on, I worked at an afterschool tutoring academy called Elogix and I have been working there since my senior year.<br><br>

        When I was in 6th grade I joined the Boy Scouts of America and stayed there until I turned 18. I achieved the rank of Life which was the 2nd highest before an Eagle Scout. I didn't reach Eagle scout because of covid19 but I have done many different projects during my time with my troop. One major project I did was give back to my elementary school. What I did was go and paint my old elementary school a brand new map of the United States because the old one was all damaged from the rain and debris over the years. I did this project during my time as a life scout and what I did for my star project was give back to the church that allowed us to hold our meetings there. <br><br>

        During my high school era, I joined my football team whilst having no experience playing football because I grew up playing basketball with my brother. I also joined my volleyball team because after watching the varsity team play one game, I was interested and wanted to learn how to play. During my freshmen year I managed to make JV for both football and volleyball. Later on during my sophmore to senior year I played all varsity. I played as a cornerback and wide reciever in football and I played opposite hitter in volleyball.
